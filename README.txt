The project examines the effectiveness of four distinct optimization algorithms: randomized hill climbing, 
simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, and MIMIC (Mutual-Information-Maximizing Input Clustering). It 
is divided into two parts. In the first part, three different optimization problems (the Traveling Salesman 
Problem (TSP), The Knapsack Problem, and the Max K-Color problem) are introduced and analyzed to 
evaluate the aforementioned algorithms. 

In the second section, three optimization algorithms are 
employed to find the optimum weights of neural networks used to predict the presence or absence of 
diabetes in a binary classification task.
